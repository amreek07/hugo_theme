###### Evaluation of IoT-Technologies in a CO2 Compensation

A few weeks ago, we had the opportunity to meet a man and learn about his impressive and courageous environmental protection and sustainability project: Avni Curri and the [KIRI WELT](http://www.paulowniatree.de/) in Mallorca. This CO2 compensation plantation enables companies to make a direct investment in sustainability and social engagement.

Together, we strolled through the still young plantation. Avni enlightened us about the tree species, which is mainly found in China and is especially known for its rapid CO2 absorption capabilities. He shared insights about its cultivation, care, and utilization in European agriculture.

With a personal goal and under the premise of contributing to environmental protection, ecology, and climate protection, Avni has built his plantation over the past few years, planting several thousand trees. With great dedication and resilience, he has accomplished something remarkable. And he has more ideas for the future: including a solar park on the greenhouses as a contribution to the mobility transition in Mallorca.

As we have already dealt extensively with the topic of IoT in the agricultural and industrial sector in the past [IoT Fluid Monitoring](https://fwdnow.io/blog/iot_fluid_monitoring/), we were particularly interested in water management of the many hectares of land during the tour.

The trees are irrigated through a system that draws water from a centrally located 20-meter-deep well, which was formerly a wind-powered Mallorcan water pump. This water is then distributed to the various fields through a robust electric control system.

This bold environmental protection project, we hypothesize, could benefit from a modern water management system: in an environment with typically low rainfall and for the irrigation of a plant species known for its low soil moisture requirements, it is ecologically sensible to monitor water levels and use an irrigation system that adapts to climatic conditions. Such a system would also consider the availability of natural resources when distributing water.

From our perspective, the *adaptation to the consequences of climate change* is often given too little attention when it comes to investments. This includes aspects such as the redesign of urban areas, cooling, flood protection, and, importantly, optimized water usage and monitoring. 

With the help of IoT water monitoring and management combined with meteorological data, it is possible to make forecasts and adjust water logistics so that every section of the plantation is optimally supplied with water. This ensures that the trees have ideal growing conditions while water is distributed smartly, efficiently, and sustainably. Available resources could be deployed precisely where needed, which is especially desirable in cases of localized low water levels and resource scarcity. Using collected data, machine learning can optimize water usage.

We would be delighted to implement such a project in the future together with Avni and his team—the enthusiasm for the cause is certainly shared on both sides.
