###### What is FinOps?

FinOps, short for Financial Operations, is an operational framework and cultural practice designed to maximize business value by managing cloud costs. It facilitates real-time decision-making through the collaboration of engineering, finance, and business teams. FinOps enables organizations to understand their cloud costs, optimize spending, and operate efficiently.

### Domains and Capabilities

FinOps domains represent various areas of activity or knowledge necessary for a successful FinOps practice. These domains ensure that all aspects of cloud financial management are covered comprehensively. FinOps capabilities define the functional areas supporting each FinOps domain. These capabilities include specific activities, key personas involved, performance metrics, and real-world practices essential for a robust FinOps practice.


### Phases

The FinOps journey is divided into three iterative phases:

1. **Inform**: Understanding cloud usage and cost.
2. **Optimize**: Identifying opportunities for cost-saving and efficiency.
3. **Operate**: Continuous improvement and operationalization of best practices.

### Personas

FinOps involves multiple personas, such as executives, finance, and engineering teams. Each persona plays a crucial role in implementing and sustaining FinOps practices, ensuring financial accountability, and optimizing cloud usage.

### Maturity

The FinOps maturity model follows a "Crawl, Walk, Run" approach, allowing organizations to start small and scale as they become more proficient in FinOps practices. This model helps organizations gradually improve their cloud financial management capabilities.
