###### What is enterprise architecture?

In today's business landscape, the seamless integration of IT and business has become a cornerstone of success. Modern enterprises are heavily reliant on information systems that enable and enhance their (core) business capabilities.

However, achieving business and IT alignment can be a difficult task. This is where the practice of enterprise architecture (sometimes called enterprise architecture management) comes into play, building a bridge between business and IT to steer the natural evolution of the enterprise. 

Because business and IT alignment requires collaboration between different players in an enterprise, a key goal of enterprise architecture is to improve communication between these different roles.

To achieve this goal, enterprise architecture provides the business with various artifacts that are used by the different stakeholders to make informed and educated decisions.

Such artifacts are for example:

- Application System Landscapes
- Conceptual & Logical Data Models
- Business Capability Models
- Process Maps

*This list is by no means exhaustive and could easily be extended to include other artifacts that are relevant for your organization. However, these artifacts are often among the first an organization develops when it launches its EA efforts.*

Such artifacts not only help bridge the gap between business and IT teams but also provide a common language that allows different departments to work harmoniously towards shared objectives.

## Enterprise Architecture Tools

Specialized software, like LeanIX, designed for EA repositories allows organizations to capture, store, and organize important data related to their operations, strategies, and technological landscape. 

This data is then made readily accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, from top-level executives to project managers and developers. As a result, decision-makers can draw insights from a unified source of truth, fostering a holistic approach to problem-solving and innovation.

Typical questions that can be answered using EA repositories like LeanIX are:

- Who is responsible for an application?
- What are the costs for supporting business capabilities?
- Where do redundancies exist in the application landscape?
- What impact does the project landscape of my enterprise have on my application landscape?
- How does the information flow in my company?

Selecting the optimal enterprise architecture repository for your organization can indeed prove to be a formidable endeavor. In this intricate process, it is imperative that your decision is firmly rooted in the unique requirements of your organization. Recognizing the dynamic nature of this challenge, the Gartner Magic Quadrant offers a vantage point for comprehending the diverse array of solutions present within the marketplace.  

As we are using LeanIX in different projects we will take a look at this solution.

## **Implementing LeanIX: Best Practices**

### Define Objectives

Before implementing LeanIX, it is essential to define clear objectives. Consider the following steps as a starting point:

- **Identify Stakeholders:** Determine who will use LeanIX and what information they need. This could include executives, project managers, architects, and developers.
- **Set Goals:** Establish specific goals for using LeanIX, such as [Application Portfolio Assessment](https://docs-eam.leanix.net/docs/application-portfolio-assessment), [Application Rationalization](https://docs-eam.leanix.net/docs/application-rationalization-use-case), or [Application Modernization](https://docs-eam.leanix.net/docs/application-modernization).

*You can always reiterate and refine these objectives as your organization's priorities evolve over time. Flexibility is key to adapting LeanIX to your changing needs.*

### Initial Data Import

Most likely you will already have some structured information about your organization's architectural artifacts and therefore you don't have to start from zero. 

At the start of your journey with LeanIX, you should gather all the already accessible information on your application landscape, your business capability model, your business process landscape, and other relevant artifacts.

After that you will have to structure the data according to the LeanIX meta-model. For this, you can just export the relevant columns of a Fact Sheet Type from LeanIX to Excel and fill the template with your data. 

That´s it! You are now ready to import your initial data into LeanIX. Just use your filled-out template and hit the import button in your LeanIX inventory. Don't worry about mistakes, as LeanIX will run the import in test-mode, providing you with feedback on possible errors that can occur during the import.

### Data Governance and Management or: Keeping your Data Up-to-Date

Data governance is the key to success when it comes to using LeanIX. After your initial import, you will want to ensure that your data is maintained.
