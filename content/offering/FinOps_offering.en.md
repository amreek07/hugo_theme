###### Optimize Your Cloud Costs Sustainably with FinOps

FinOps, short for Financial Operations, is an operational framework and cultural practice aimed at maximizing business value by optimizing cloud costs. We assist you in initiating and professionalizing FinOps in your company to understand cloud costs, optimize expenses, and work efficiently.

Each session lasts 45 minutes and is designed to provide actionable insights and solutions for your specific challenges. The sessions are held virtually, allowing you to participate conveniently from anywhere.

## What to Expect
During your 45-minute online session, you’ll have the opportunity to:

- **Discuss your challenges**: Share your specific issues or projects and receive expert advice on how to approach them.
- **Explore solutions**: Learn about FinOps First Steps, best practices, and strategies that can be applied to your situation.
- **Gain clarity**: Leave the session with a clearer understanding of how to advance your FinOps initiatives.

These sessions are informal but focused to ensure you get the most value out of your time.

### Why FinOps?

FinOps enables sustainable cloud cost optimization: lower costs for the same performance and cloud architectures that truly leverage the cloud's benefits. Our experience in FinOps and cost optimization projects shows that cost reductions of up to 30% are not uncommon.

### Our Projects and the FinOps Framework

The FinOps Framework offers a structured approach to implementing FinOps within your organization. It provides an overview of all relevant skills, stakeholders, roles, etc., needed to establish a FinOps organization. Together, we prioritize the relevant aspects and develop a specific approach tailored to you.

### FinOps Tooling – from On-Board Cloud Tools to FinOps Suites like Apptio

We work with you using both the onboard cost analytics tools and FinOps suites like Apptio and similar solutions. While onboard tooling is suitable for initial cost optimization and cloud governance, FinOps suites are ideal for multi-cloud setups.
