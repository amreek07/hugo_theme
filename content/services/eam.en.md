Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) aligns IT, application landscapes, and processes with the current and future needs of your business domains. Enterprise Architecture Management is a discipline that forms the framework for the functional, technical and strategic dimensions of the organization.

## North Star - Target Vision

Systematic development of IT is a challenge for IT management. Whether the goal is modernization, optimizing business process support, or cost reduction, the organization needs a clear direction to operate independently.

To ensure all parts of the company work towards the same goals, a unified direction must be established, which encompasses multiple levels:

    1. Business strategy and specific developments
    2. Technological and architectural target vision
    3. Ways of working

A significant advantage of having a common target vision is that all stakeholders in the company can work autonomously and responsibly in a unified direction. This "Mission-Based" leadership style in a transformation has decisive advantages over a centralized "Command and Control" approach. Local decisions can be made promptly, something a centralized transformation approach would find challenging to achieve.

## Transparency

A primary task of Enterprise Architecture is to achieve transparency over the current state of the application landscape. This includes the applications in use, their roles, business objects, and dependencies within the application landscape. Transparency in the application landscape and architecture is the foundation for informed development of your company.

## Transformation Roadmap

Achieving the target state may require a variety of measures, such as enabling IT to respond to the challenges of a transformation program or specific actions to optimize the use of cloud services and architectures. The transformation roadmap develops the application landscape step-by-step towards the target vision.
