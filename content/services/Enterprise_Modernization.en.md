The focus of our activities is on the modernization of companies in both business and IT areas. We work systematically with an Enterprise Modernization Framework that covers all key areas of the company, from strategy, operations, and shared services to IT. We aim to address the specific challenges faced by both mid-sized companies and large enterprises.

The drivers for modernization are reflected in our services:

## Business Process Optimization

Many companies are held back by their poorly automated and inadequately IT-supported processes. We help you identify bottlenecks in a data-driven way and develop response strategies. [Our Process Optimization Services]({{< ref "business-process.en.md" >}} "Our Process Optimization Services")

## Enterprise Architecture Management

An application landscape that is not well-aligned with the company's goals hinders business success. Often, the functional support is not optimally aligned with the needs of the business units. We help you develop the right architecture for your company. [Our EAM Services]({{< ref "eam.en.md" >}} "Our EAM Services")

## Innovation Acceleration

Developing new services and products while maintaining ongoing operations is a challenge. The innovative potential of your employees is often hampered by established structures within the company. We assist you in structuring and operationalizing your innovation processes.

## Cloud Transformation

The step-by-step professionalization of cloud usage to accelerate IT is a challenge many companies face today. We help you identify and follow the right path for your needs.

## Cost Optimization & FinOps

IT cost optimization allows you to achieve more with the same capital investment. We assist you in both the short-term cost optimization of IT services, IT processes, and cloud services, as well as the long-term establishment of governance frameworks.
