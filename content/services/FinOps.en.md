Ongoing cloud costs are typically a significant part of IT expenses. As infrastructure grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to understand which services are generating which costs. Costs are hidden across various areas, such as storage, compute, services, governance, and forgotten environments. In some cases, costs can be temporarily reduced. Often, there are substantial savings opportunities that can be implemented quickly and have a long-term impact.

## What is FinOps?

FinOps stands for Cloud Financial Operations or Cloud Financial Management. It is a governance model that has been developed since the early phases of cloud adoption. The key aspect of the FinOps governance model is to establish financial accountability for cloud spending and to make better business decisions based on this data.

Speed, cost, and quality play a crucial role in this process. FinOps is established by empowering teams and supporting them with a centralized (or external) expert group in cloud cost management and optimization. This approach benefits many areas across the organization, such as IT and finance, by enhancing transparency and decision-making capabilities.

## Why should you consider FinOps consulting?

By implementing FinOps, you gain better visibility into your cloud spending. Applying FinOps leads to closer collaboration among different teams, giving you a better understanding of cloud expenses and enhancing financial control. Teams that take responsibility for cloud spending and have access to real-time data can optimize expenditures based on company goals.
