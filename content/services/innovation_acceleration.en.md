Identifying and accelerating innovative ideas within a company should be a priority. Continuously renewing and expanding the business model helps companies remain competitive and respond flexibly to changing situations. Various factors promote innovation within a company. Our team has supported the entire process in organizations, from internal scouting for ideas, implementing innovation projects, and providing embedded coaching for teams and sales, to setting up innovation labs and introducing company-wide innovation processes and governance. 

## Identification, Selection, and Acceleration

The rate of renewal for services and products in a company can be significantly increased when the relevant forces within the organization are systematically strengthened and supported. It's important not only to focus on innovation ideas but also to identify the innovation drivers within the company and activate them through targeted support and freedom to innovate. A crucial part of activating the company is generating momentum within the appropriate teams. The implementation of ideas often encounters significant resistance: resources for implementation may be lacking, processes may be too slow, or stakeholders in the company may prevent progress due to the "not invented here" syndrome.
