The scalability of a company heavily depends on how effectively its core business processes are supported by IT. When interfaces are lacking, there are gaps in media, or many steps in the process need to be performed manually because the software does not meet essential requirements, business functions quickly become bottlenecks. 

Additionally, processes that have high friction and poor user experience can significantly impact employee satisfaction and retention rates. We systematically work on optimizing your processes based on the following dimensions:
    - Speed
    - Quality
    - Cost 

## Situation & Priorities

We collaborate with you upfront to define the scope and priorities for process optimization. This could involve improving processes in areas such as Sales, Marketing, Finance, Procurement, IT Services, and more. During this phase, we identify specific focus areas and potential pain points, such as low throughput, lack of transparency, or low levels of automation that could benefit from optimization.

## Process Transparency

The foundation for optimizing workflows and improving IT support is a detailed assessment and analysis of the current process state. Together with your teams, we identify and classify key pain points, such as missing interfaces, insufficient functionality, manual process steps, or unclear responsibilities. The results of the process analysis are discussed with the team and relevant stakeholders to ensure alignment and clarity.

## Process Optimization

Based on our findings, we derive options to improve the process in line with the desired optimization dimensions. We consider both organizational solutions and technological options, with a strong focus on automation. We leverage a full range of solutions, including SaaS applications, workflow engines, custom cloud solutions, and tools that we can implement quickly using a low-code approach.

## KPIs

We place great importance on a data-driven approach in our optimization strategies. The use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a critical component for long-term success measurement and monitoring of processes.
