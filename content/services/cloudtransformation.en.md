Leveraging the cloud is an enabler for your IT and a key accelerator for your business development. However, many companies encounter significant resistance or fail to realize the desired benefits when introducing the cloud as a foundation for their IT. We assist you in setting the right focus areas in your cloud strategy and its operationalization.

## Choosing a Cloud Provider

GCP, AWS, Azure, or IONOS—selecting the right cloud provider determines many subsequent developments, from costs and team skill development to the ability to utilize specialized services from the provider’s Machine Learning or IoT toolkits. We help you evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different providers based on your specific scenario.

## Architecture Scenarios

Whether you are building a new application or modernizing an existing one, at some point, you'll need to decide on the architectural and technological direction for your future application. We assist you in designing and evaluating different scenarios to choose the optimal path that meets your requirements.

## Cloud RFPs

For public contracts, tenders are required for the implementation or operation of services on cloud platforms. We help you establish the foundation for your RFPs.

## Architecture Reviews

Too expensive? Too slow? Too inflexible? Sometimes, solution and IT architectures reach their limits. We assist with detailed architecture reviews to help eliminate these obstacles.

## Planning Cloud Migration

The journey to the cloud needs careful planning. Due diligence provides a foundation for migrating IT systems and resources to the cloud. We work with you to develop a suitable strategy to transition to the cloud step by step.

## Proof of Concepts

Quickly testing ideas is one of the strengths of the cloud. We support you in designing and implementing technical and business proof of concepts in the cloud.

## Cloud Competency Teams

Building Cloud Competency Teams is a crucial element in embedding cloud usage within a company. We help you establish your Cloud Competency Team, from concept development and support in the hiring process to operational collaboration with the team.
