Our Business Capability Dashboard offers a dynamic and comprehensive view of your organization's capabilities. You can easily navigate through various levels of your capability model, selecting the depth of detail that suits your needs. For each capability, you can view the number of applications supporting it, along with their classification as either commodity or differentiating capabilities. Additionally, the scope of each capability—whether global, regional, or local—is clearly displayed.

For instance, when examining a specific capability like "Pricing Strategy," you can delve into the supporting applications. By clicking on the number of applications, you gain access to detailed information, including each application's lifecycle status, disposition model, and the specific services it provides. These services, which represent the functionality offered to the business (e.g., payroll management, employee onboarding in an HR application), are crucial for rationalization and gap analysis. This helps determine whether all supporting applications are necessary or if some can be streamlined.

To ensure a thorough understanding, we do not directly connect applications to capabilities. Instead, we map them through processes and organizational units. This approach is essential in large organizations, where different entities may perform the same process using various applications, often due to regulatory requirements, mergers, or historical autonomy. Understanding these processes across the organization is vital for effective rationalization and integration.

Furthermore, the dashboard allows you to compare applications based on the services they provide, their costs, and their usage. In our rationalization analysis view, you can select applications for comparison, assess their overlap, and explore scenarios for retiring or enhancing certain applications. This analysis supports informed decision-making by highlighting potential cost savings and optimization opportunities. Finally, you can scope your view by different criteria, such as business unit hierarchy or acquisitions, to tailor the analysis to your specific organizational needs.
