## Simple Data Capture Technology

Everyone’s Essential enables anyone within the organization to effortlessly capture and maintain data, without requiring any familiarity with Enterprise Architecture (EA) or the Essential platform. For Enterprise Architects, having access to accurate and comprehensive data is crucial for making informed decisions. This data often resides in various forms and locations, whether within systems or in the minds of individuals across the organization.

## APIs

If your data is already accurately managed in a system, it is more effective to utilize the Essential APIs to integrate that data rather than recapturing it. Just confirm the data's quality, designate the master source, and you are set to move forward.

## Excel, XML, CSV

Ideal for quick initial data collection, especially since many organizations already store a wealth of information in spreadsheets that can be directly imported into Essential. The Essential Launchpad offers a pre-configured spreadsheet template to help capture a baseline across business, application, data, and technology domains. With spreadsheet data at hand, you can get started and see tangible benefits with Essential within days. Additionally, the Editors allow for ongoing data maintenance.

## Manual Capture

Manual capture enables detailed data entry and maintenance for complex enterprise architecture modeling, typically managed by the EA team and architects.

## Actionable Views

Essential offers approximately 130 pre-configured, user-friendly visualizations tailored to various EA needs, including APM, strategy management, roadmapping, and digital transformation.

These visualizations range from high-level strategic views ideal for discussions with senior management, business users, and key stakeholders, to detailed architecture views specifically designed for your team. Moreover, Essential provides exceptional flexibility, allowing you to easily create custom views and visualizations that align precisely with your organization’s unique requirements.

## Using the Essential Import Utility

The Essential import utility streamlines the process of importing large volumes of data from spreadsheets, making it easy to quickly populate key classes and views. To simplify the process further, Essential provides pre-configured spreadsheets and Import Specifications, which are readily available through Essential Launchpad and our Essential view loaders.
