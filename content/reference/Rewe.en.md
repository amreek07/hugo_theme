## Organizational Restructuring and Modernization

### Challenge

The client was in the middle of organizational restructuring and at the
start of a multi-year modernization and transformation project. At this point, there was a need for a central enterprise architecture team and to strengthen solution architects to support the transformation. [Our EAM Services]({{< ref "eam.en.md" >}} "Our EAM Services")

### Strategic Solution

The forwardnow team did assume the interim management role of the EAM team, assessing architects for different EAM and product roles. A roadmap for the EA Operating Model and Services was created, covering aspects such as: architecture standards, technical debt management, architecture board & governance, training & know-how transfer, architecture-board, project support, business alignment, target architecture, transparency application landscape, data and integration architecture, architecture reviews, system responsibilities, etc. Furthermore, we helped to introduce LeanIX EAM Tool to the organization, creating transparency of relevant Key entities of the enterprise architecture.

**Recruitment**  
Identifying and assessing architects for various EAM and product roles.  

**EA Operating Model**  
Developing a comprehensive roadmap for the EA operating model, focusing on aspects like architecture standards, technical debt management, governance, and training.

**Tools Implementation**  
Introducing EAM Tools(e.g. LeanIX) to create transparency and manage key enterprise architecture entities.  

### Results

Together with key stakeholders of the client, we have established an architecture practice that plays an active role in the transformation and modernization of the application landscape. This not only aligns the architecture with business needs but also renews the technology stack.
